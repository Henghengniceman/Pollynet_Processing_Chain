### Description

This document will show you how the pollynet processing program works and how to add a new processing routine for new polly systems. Before your reading, we highly suggest you to turn to the paper "The automated multiwavelength Raman polarization and water-vapor lidar PollyXT: the neXT generation" to have a general idea about **PollyXT**.

### Workflow

</center>

Top is the flowchart of the processing program. It includes three main processing parts, create processing task, find processing function and activate processing.

The [fileinfo_new.txt](../todo_filelist/fileinfo_new.txt) is generated by top-level function which is controlled by our pollynet website maintainers. In this file, there contains the folder and file of the stored polly raw data, instrument label, data size and so on. For processing program, the data file is necessary to start a processing task and the instrument label is used to search for the proper running configurations. (The configurations of different polly can be found in [pollynet.md](pollynet.md)). In the fileinfo_new.txt, each row content stands for a new task. All the task related info will be saved in [taskInfo](#taskinfo)

Every polly lidar system is not stationary system. It is either container based or box-based which can be transferred to remote locations. PollyNET is aimed at measuring the aerosol distribution globally and the same lidar instrument can join different campaigns. The history campaign info can be loaded by searching the information stored in [pollynet_history_of_places_new.txt](../todo_filelist/pollynet_history_of_places_new.txt). After that, we can got the polly data file, polly version and location info. These info will be saved in [campaignInfo](#campaigninfo). With these info, we can search the predefined polly configuration, defaults and precessing function file by looking through [pollynet_processing_config_history.txt](../config/pollynet_processing_config_history.txt). Detailed information about polly configuration and defaults can be found in [polly_config.md](polly_config.md) and [polly_defaults.md](polly_defaults.md).

Then it will active the processing chain for the stored polly data. As different polly system can provide different products and in the future the newly built polly system can even provide some extradinary products which we could never imagine, therefore it's better not to keep the processing flowchart fixed. In the figure above, only the typical processing flow of pollyxt is displayed. But we should keep in mind, it can be super easy to be extended as the way you like. Regarding to how to make it extended, please go to [Howto](#How-to-add-a-new-polly-process-function).

#### read polly data

For a normal processing function, it will start with reading the polly raw data. At present, all the data is stored in [netcdf](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/) format. MATLAB has provided with a lot of netcdf functions which can help you have a quick look inside the data file. Also you can follow the [read function](../lib/polly_read_rawdata.m) in this repository. Remember all the data sharing in the program is via **data** struct. This can simplify the definition part of inputs and outputs for each processing function. But it will make the struct very complicated and swelling as the processing runs. You can find the detailed information about this struct in [here](#data).

#### signal preprocessing

**For the following parts, I will assume you have a lidar background.**

PMT in the lidar receiving part will convert the light signal into electric signal. And signal recorder will sample the electric current into digit data and save them in our storage disk. Basically, there are two ways to sample the signal, photon counting and AD conversion. They both have their limits and expertise. For our decades experiences, we found the photon counting is better for our polly systems. But for photon counting system, we need to dealing with [deadtime effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_time). 

Three different correction schemes are embedded in the preprocessing function. You can find the detailed information in [polly_config.md](polly_config.md). Although some of the deadtime effects can be corrected in some degree, we still want to warn the users not to apply the signal with Photon Count Rate above 70 MHz.

Then, we need to substract the background from the raw signal. The background can be calculated by using the pretriggering signal (1-250 bin for pollyxt system).

Also we will make a depol-calibration mask and fog mask by inspecting the angle of the polarizer and signal strength at certain height.

#### Depol-Calibration

For pollyxt systems, the depol-calibration is implemented by using the $\pm\Delta45Â°$ method. Polly will start serveral automatic calibration processes everyday. We can extract the calibration profiles by comparing the angle of the polarizer or we can pre-defined the calibration time in the configuration file (Default way).

#### cloud-screen

There are different ways to realize cloud-screen, gradient method, wavelet method, variance method and so on. No matter which kind of method you use, you have to set a threshold. In the program, I only used the gradient method with comparing the slope of range-corrected signal to the pre-defined threshold. We can control the filtering strength by using different thresholds. In the overlap estimation part, the results is highly sensible with cloud contamination. Therefore, we can decrease the threshold to further limit the filtering.

#### overlap estimation

There are two basic ways to estimate the overlap function for polly system. Firstly, using the Raman signal and tuning the overlap to achieve the convergence between Klett retrieving results and Raman retrieving results. But this method is controlled by the assumed lidar ratio and not easy to be implemented in an automatic way. Secondly, we can take advantage of the Near-Range and Far-Range channel, as the full overlap height for the Near-Range channel is only 120 m, we can easily estimate the overlap of Far-Range channel down to 120m by comparing the signal ratio between Near-Range and Far-Range signal.

#### period-splitting

This part is used to split the continuous cloud-free profiles into several certain-length subgroups. The default length is 60 min.

#### read meteor data

This part is used to read the meteorological data. We have GDAS1 profiles in our server, which we can access with one-day delay. Therefore for realtime analysis, we need standard-atmosphere model data. Besides, an interface of reading radiosonde is also added to support the data analysis from Polarstern cruise.

#### rayleigh fitting

Rayleigh fitting part is used to search the reference height for aerosol retrieving. The philosophy is based on the similarity between the detected signal and pure molecular signal. Detailed information can be found in **Pollynet_Processing_Chain.pptx**

#### transmission correction

Normally, the transmission ratio of parallel and vertical polarized component is not 1. Therefore, the signal in the total channel does not strictly equal to elastic signal. You can find the correction formula in **dissertation_baars.pdf**.

#### klett and raman retrieving

You can find thousands of documents about the analysis of klett and raman method. Read one or two of them, then you can easily understand this part in the program.

#### water vapor calibration

The key about water vapor calibration is to find a standard instrument. For most of PollyNET site, you can find a collocated AERONET site. You can find the site by looking at [AERONET-station-list](AERONET-station-list.txt) or go to [AERONET website](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/type_one_station_opera_v2_new). Detailed information about the calibration method can be found in [Guangyao's paper](https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/11/2735/2018/).

For LACROS campaign, there will be a good option by using the IWV from MWR. Because, MWR can provide nighttime measurement results which is ideal for water vapor calibration. You need to specify the folder of the MWR products to allow the program to read the IWV. Go to **pollyxt_lacros** to have a look.

#### lidar calibration

Lidar calibration is based on the Raman or Klett retrieving results. At present, overlap correction is not implemented, which means the klett method could suffer a strong overlap effect at the lower altitude. In the calibration part, we treat the blind area to be constant. This is a good assumption at most conditions, but we should keep in mind if there is low level aerosol layers, it will create very large deviations. So our priority is using the Raman results when it is available.

```
O'Connor method has been tested. But for the photon counting system, it's not so pratical due to deadtime effects. But we need to keep an eye on this, because this can complement the scope of the calibrated conditions.
